## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.5.1+ (for frontend)
- Go 1.19+ (for backend)
- Gmail account with app password (for email features)

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: Svelte 5.0.0
- **Backend**: Gin 1.10.0 with air 1.61.7 (hot reloading)
- **Database**: SQLite 3.45.1 with GORM 1.25.12
- **Email**: Gmail SMTP

## üîß Development Setup

### 1. Email Configuration

Set up Gmail app password following [Google's guide](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en), then:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Update .env with your Gmail credentials
```

### 2. Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`

### 3. Backend Development

```bash
air
```

This creates a `data/` directory for the database and static files.

| Role     | Email                    | Password   |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Admin    | `admin@example.com`      | `admin`    |
